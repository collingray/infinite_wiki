            <p>Luigi Galleani was born on August 12, 1861, into a middle-class family, in the
                Piedmontese city of Vercelli. He first became interested in anarchism while studying law at the
                University of Turin, eventually renouncing his career in law in order to carry out an anarchist
                propaganda against capitalism and the state.</p>

            <p>For his involvement in the anti-war movement during World War I, he was deported back to
                Italy, where he was subjected to political repression following the rise of fascism. During the final
                years of his life, he published "The End of Anarchism?", a defense of anarchist communism from
                criticisms by reformist socialists.</p>

            <p>Galleani was an active participant in the Italian labor movement, organizing strikes and
                protests against the exploitation of workers by factory owners. He was also a vocal critic of the
                Italian monarchy and the Catholic Church, which he saw as complicit in the oppression of the working
                class.</p>

            <h3 id="exile">Exile</h3>
            <p>Following the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900, Galleani was forced to flee
                the country to avoid arrest. He settled in the United States, where he continued his anarchist
                activities, publishing the influential anarchist newspaper "Cronaca Sovversiva" and advocating for the
                use of violence to achieve social change.</p>
            <h3 id="life-in-the-united-states">Life in the United States</h3>
            <p>Galleani's radical views and advocacy of violence made him a target of the U.S. government,
                which sought to deport him as an undesirable alien. In 1919, he was arrested and charged with
                "criminal anarchy" for his alleged role in a series of bombings and assassination attempts carried out
                by his followers.</p>

            <p>After serving a prison sentence, Galleani was deported back to Italy in 1920, where he
                continued to write and agitate for anarchist revolution until his death in 1931. Despite his
                controversial
                tactics and violent methods, he remains a revered figure in the history of anarchist thought, inspiring
                generations of radicals and revolutionaries to challenge the status quo and fight for a more just and
                equitable society.</p>

            <h2 id="political-ideology">Political ideology</h2>
            <p>Galleani was an insurrectionary anarchist who believed that acts of violence, such as
                bombings and assassinations, were necessary to overthrow the existing social order and create a new
                society based on anarchist principles. He rejected the idea of gradual reform or peaceful protest,
                arguing that only through direct action and armed struggle could the working class achieve liberation
                from capitalist exploitation and state oppression.</p>
            <h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
            <p>Galleani's followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and
                assassination attempts in the United States and Italy, targeting government officials, police officers,
                and industrialists. Although many of these attacks were unsuccessful and resulted in the deaths of
                innocent bystanders, they helped to spread fear and panic among the ruling class and inspire other
                anarchists to take up arms against the state.</p>
